# Capital Cities for Glyphs

Back in 2015 I was a student in the Type and Media master’s program. There, I was faced with the fact that I spend a rather limited amount of time outside, or basically anywhere else that wasn’t the studio or my flat.

Faced with urgent wanderlust and the task to judge the relation of uppercase and lowercase letters, I created this little script. It generates a random list of cities from A to Z based on data from http://www.geonames.org/. There is also a Robofont-friendly version for the Space Center.
