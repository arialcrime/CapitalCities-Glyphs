# Capital Cities for Glyphs

Back in 2015 I was a student in the Type and Media program. There, I was faced with the fact that I spent a rather limited amount of time outside, or basically anywhere else apart from the studio or Spui.

Struggling with urgent wanderlust and the task to judge the relation of uppercase and lowercase letters, I created this little script. It generates a random list of city names from A to Z based on data from http://www.geonames.org/. There is also a Robofont-friendly version for the Space Center.

A beta version of this script rendered Philipp Neumeyerâ€™s GlyphsApp unusable for an afternoon, but he assured me that this version is fine.
